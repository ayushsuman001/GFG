# Project Collection

This repository contains four distinct projects implemented in C. Each project focuses on a specific domain:

1. Grocery Billing System
   - Description: A simple command-line grocery billing system that calculates the total amount for items purchased.
   - File: `grocery_billing_system.c`

2. Matrix Operations
   - Description: A program that performs various operations on matrices, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, transpose, and inverse.
   - File: `matrix_operations.c`

3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game
   - Description: Implementation of a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid.
   - File: `tic_tac_toe.c`

4. Voting System
   - Description: A simple voting system allowing the addition of candidates and voters, casting votes, and displaying election results.
   - File: `voting_system.c`

## Instructions for Each Project

### Grocery Billing System

1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   gcc grocery_billing_system.c -o grocery_billing_system
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./grocery_billing_system
   ```

### Matrix Operations

1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   gcc matrix_operations.c -o matrix_operations
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./matrix_operations
   ```

3. Follow on-screen instructions to perform matrix operations.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   gcc tic_tac_toe.c -o tic_tac_toe
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./tic_tac_toe
   ```

3. Play the Tic-Tac-Toe game by entering row and column numbers.

### Voting System

1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   gcc voting_system.c -o voting_system
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./voting_system
   ```

3. Follow on-screen menu options to add candidates, voters, cast votes, and view election results.

## Additional Notes

- Each project is implemented in C and can be compiled using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- Make sure to adjust the compilation and execution commands based on your operating system and compiler.

Feel free to explore each project, modify the code, and integrate additional features as needed.
```

Replace the compilation and execution commands based on your operating system and preferences. This README provides a brief overview of each project and instructions on how to compile and run them.
